# Ethernet Overview

## What is Ethernet
Ethernet is a traditional wired networking technology used in LAN or WAN. Devices communicate using protocols and physical cables to transmit data. It is widely used due to its speed, security, and reliability.

## Advantages of Ethernet
Relatively low cost  
Backward compatibility  
Resistant to signal interference  
High data transfer quality  
High speed  
Reliable connection  
High data security with common firewall support  

## Disadvantages of Ethernet
Best suited for small, short-range networks  
Limited mobility due to physical cables  
Long cables may cause crosstalk  
Not ideal for real-time or interactive applications  
Speed can decrease with heavy traffic  
No acknowledgment from receivers for data delivery  
Difficult to troubleshoot specific cable or node issues  

## Ethernet vs Wi-Fi
Ethernet uses cables, offering better speed, stability, and lower latency  
Wi-Fi provides flexibility without cables, but may have lower speed and security  

## How Ethernet Works
Operates at Layer 1 and Layer 2 of the OSI model.  
Data is sent in frames containing MAC addresses, VLAN tags, QoS info, and error correction.  
Originally used hubs, now mostly uses switches that direct data more efficiently.  

## Ethernet Evolution
802.3u introduced Fast Ethernet (100 Mbps)  
802.3af defines Power over Ethernet (PoE)  
802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax are wireless equivalents (Wi-Fi)  
Gigabit Ethernet supports 1 Gbps to 400 Gbps  

## Ethernet Cable Types
Cat5 supports basic Ethernet and 100BASE-T  
Cat5e supports Gigabit Ethernet  
Cat6 supports 10 Gigabit Ethernet  
Crossover cables connect two similar devices without a switch or router
