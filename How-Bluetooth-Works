## Summary

Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology that allows devices to communicate without cables. It's commonly used in headphones, smartwatches, keyboards, car audio systems, and more.

## Types of Connections

Bluetooth allows direct communication between devices (unlike WiFi, which requires a router). There are two main types:

- Bluetooth Classic (BR/EDR)  
  Used for point-to-point communication with higher data rates.

- Bluetooth Low Energy (LE)  
  Consumes less power, supports mesh networks and broadcasting. Ideal for devices like fitness trackers.

## How It Works

Bluetooth Classic requires a pairing process, which allows devices to trust each other and securely exchange data. Bluetooth LE can broadcast messages without pairing, though pairing is still possible when needed.

Connected Bluetooth devices form a small network called a piconet. These networks use frequency hopping to stay connected and avoid interference from other wireless technologies.

## Bluetooth Range

Bluetooth range varies depending on several factors:

- Radio spectrum
- Physical Layer (PHY)
- Receiver sensitivity
- Transmission power
- Antenna gain
- Path loss (e.g., distance, walls, or obstacles)

Recent Bluetooth updates include forward error correction (FEC), which improves range without increasing power consumption.

## Bluetooth Security

Bluetooth includes several security features:

- Pairing with encryption key exchange
- Encrypted data transmission
- Device address randomization (to prevent tracking)
- Authentication using a pairing code (e.g., when connecting a phone to a car)

Users can control device visibility by turning off discoverability or disabling Bluetooth when not in use.
