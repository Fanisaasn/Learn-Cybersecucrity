Infrared (IR) â€“ Definition and Security Risks
Definition
Infrared (IR) is a wireless communication method used for short- to mid-range data transmission between devices. 
It has a longer wavelength than visible light but shorter than radio waves. IR radiation is invisible to the human eye and can only be detected by specific sensors or cameras.

Advantages
Commonly used in IoT devices and remote controls
Efficient for short-range device communication

Limitations
Limited range
Requires direct line-of-sight between devices
Low data transfer speed
Susceptible to interference and poor penetration through objects
Potential security vulnerabilities

Examples of Misuse by Hackers
Spoofing devices on the same Wi-Fi network using smart IR bulbs
Intercepting and controlling IR connections to steal sensitive data such as credentials, messages, and emails
Exploiting vulnerabilities in IR-based IoT devices to access user data
Gaining access to IR-based security cameras to monitor activities and infiltrate company systems
