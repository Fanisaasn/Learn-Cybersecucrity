# What is WiFi and How Does it Work? [27]

## What is WiFi
WiFi (802.11 networking) enables wireless internet using radio waves.

How it works:
- The device’s wireless adapter converts data into radio signals.
- These signals are transmitted via antenna.
- A wireless router receives the signals and forwards them to the internet via Ethernet.

WiFi works on:
- **2.4 GHz** – slower but longer range.
- **5 GHz** – faster but shorter range.

## 802.11 Standards
| Standard   | Frequency | Speed         | Notes                         |
|------------|-----------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| 802.11b    | 2.4 GHz   | 11 Mbps       | Older, low speed              |
| 802.11a    | 5 GHz     | 54 Mbps       | Uses OFDM                     |
| 802.11g    | 2.4 GHz   | 54 Mbps       | Faster with OFDM              |
| 802.11n    | 2.4/5 GHz | Up to 140 Mbps| Multiple antennas (MIMO)      |

## Summary
WiFi uses radio signals for wireless communication. Devices connect via wireless adapters, and routers link them to the internet. WiFi speed and range depend on frequency and the standard used.
