## What is NFC
NFC (Near Field Communication) is a short-range wireless communication technology that allows two devices to exchange data when they are very close together (typically within 2 inches). It is a subset of RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification).

## Common Uses of NFC
- Mobile payments: Apple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay
- Access cards for buildings and garages
- Contactless debit/credit cards ("tap to pay")

## NFC Security
- Uses dynamic encryption: data changes with every transaction
- Employs tokenization: original card details are replaced with random numbers (tokens)
- Protected by biometric authentication like fingerprint or facial recognition
- More secure than magnetic stripe cards

## How NFC Works
1. The user taps or hovers their device near an NFC-enabled reader.
2. Communication occurs using the 13.56 MHz frequency.
3. Encrypted information is exchanged between the devices.
4. Payment is completed within seconds.

## NFC vs. EMV
| NFC                                | EMV (Chip Cards)                     |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Wireless communication             | Physical chip inserted               |
| Used for mobile/contactless payments | Used for chip card payments         |
| Faster transaction speed           | Slower due to authentication steps   |
| Both are encrypted and secure      | Both are encrypted and secure        |

## Why Accept NFC in Your Business
- **More secure**: tokenization and biometric verification make fraud difficult
- **Faster**: NFC transactions are quicker than both magstripe and EMV chip transactions
- **More convenient**: customers can pay using smartphones without needing a physical wallet

## How to Pay with NFC
1. Add your card to a digital wallet app (e.g., Apple Pay, Google Pay).
2. Hold the device close to the payment terminal.
3. Authenticate using fingerprint or face recognition.
4. Transaction is processed automatically.

## How to Accept NFC Payments
- Use an NFC-enabled payment reader (e.g., Square Reader).
- Accepts both mobile wallets and contactless cards.
- Ideal for modern, secure, and efficient in-person payments.
